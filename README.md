# Responsive-Portfolio-Website
Portfolio Website Project - Google Nanodegree - Front End Web Developer Program
This portfolio project is built using HTML5 CSS JavaScript and jQuery.
I made the site responsive - so the user has a clean experience no matter what device they are browsing from.
The Images in the Featured work section take the user to my projects.
The most fun part was creating the progress bars showing my skill level in various coding languages and tools.
